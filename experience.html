			<p>I have lived in Toronto my entire life. For me, it will always be home.</p>
			<p>The good and the bad, the ups and the downs, the wins and the losses, all become bareable because I know this is a place I can call home no matter where I am in life.</p>
			<P>I have seen Toronto grow, and with it, I have also grown. I have seen Toronto change, and with it, I have also changed. I have seen Toronto alive, and with it, I have also learned to live.</p>
			<p>Thank you Toronto for being the best home I could ever ask for.</p>
